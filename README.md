In the top level here, I've uploaded a sampling of Javascript classes (*.js) I've written from 2019-2022 for Xendee, a platform which won First Prize in the 2021 Edison Awards for "Critical Human Infrastructure."

In the directories are some older samples (EcmaScript, React, Redux, .NET Core, C#, Entity Framework, PostGreSQL) from two projects I worked on for Presidio (NGRM cybersecurity app) from 2017-2019.
